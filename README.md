**Task Management**
Task Management is a small-purpose website that allows users to create tasks, set due dates, and mark tasks as completed by checking a checkbox. This straightforward task management tool has been incredibly helpful in my job, and I believe it will benefit others as well.

Features
Task Creation: Users can create new tasks and specify due dates.
Task Completion: Mark tasks as completed by checking the associated checkbox.
Search Functionality: Easily search through tasks to find specific ones.
Pagination: Navigate through tasks using pagination.
Task Statistics: View the total count of tasks, along with counts of completed and incomplete tasks.
I developed this project in 3-4 hours, and it has greatly improved my productivity. I hope it will be just as helpful to you.
